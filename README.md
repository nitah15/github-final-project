A calculator that calculates simple interest given principal, annual rate of interest and time period in years.
Input:
   p, principal amount
   t, time period in years
   r, annual rate of interest
Output
   simple interest = p*t*r


This simple interest calculator performs the following computation: simple interest = p*t*r

Where:

P = Principal amount (initial investment)

R = Annual rate of interest (in percent)

T = Time period (in years)

Technologies Used
